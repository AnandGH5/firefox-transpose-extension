## \#\# Acknowledgments & Shout-outs 🙏

This extension stands on the shoulders of giants. The core audio processing is powered by the incredible **Tone.js** framework.

[Tone.js](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js) is a powerful Web Audio framework for creating interactive music directly in the browser. It simplifies the complex Web Audio API into an intuitive, high-level toolset with advanced scheduling, effects, and instruments.

A huge thank you to the creators and contributors of Tone.js for developing such an amazing open-source library. Their work is the engine that makes the real-time pitch shifting in **this extension** possible.
